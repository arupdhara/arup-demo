# 🎓 Campus Jugaad: The Hyper-Local Campus Marketplace

**"Summon a Hero. Delegate your chaos."**

### ◆ Problem Statement
University campuses are isolated economies with inefficient "favor" systems. Students struggle to find help for small tasks (printing, food delivery, laundry pickup) while others have free time but no way to monetize it. Existing platforms (Dunzo, Uber) cannot enter hostels or classrooms.

### ◆ Proposed Solution
**Campus Jugaad** is a closed-loop, secure marketplace designed exclusively for university campuses. It transforms the informal economy into a tech-driven system where students can outsource tasks to verified peers ("Heroes") safely.

### 🌟 Key Features (New & Improved)
1.  **🔐 Closed-Campus Authentication (New)**
    * **Sign Up/Login:** Secure access restricted to university email IDs (e.g., `@nit.ac.in`). This creates a "Trusted Zone" where every user is a verified student.
    
2.  **💬 In-App Hero Chat (New)**
    * **Real-Time Negotiation:** Task Providers and Heroes can chat instantly to clarify details ("Which print shop?", "Room number?") without sharing personal phone numbers, preserving privacy.

3.  **🛡️ Escrow-Backed Payments**
    * Funds are locked when a task is posted and only released via a secure OTP verification upon completion.

### 📊 Feasibility & Impact
* **Market Size:** ~5,000 students per average technical campus.
* **Economic Impact:** projected **₹50,000+** monthly transaction volume in pilot phase.
* **Time Saving:** Average student saves **~3 hours/week** by outsourcing logistics.

### 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Frontend:** React.js, Vite, Tailwind CSS (Glassmorphism UI).
* **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js.
* **Database:** MySQL (Relational Data for transactions).
* **Auth:** JWT / Custom Campus Verification.
